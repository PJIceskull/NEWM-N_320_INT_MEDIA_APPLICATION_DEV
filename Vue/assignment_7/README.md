## About Project

For this project I will be creating a vue project when the user can sort and filter information about certain team members.

This project will:

- Help me understand basic disciplinary knowledge and methods/tools.
- Apply basic disciplinary/knowledge and problem-solving skills.
- Challenge My knowledge of an application structure of a Vue project.
